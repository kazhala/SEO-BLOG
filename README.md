> A multi user blogging website built with Next.js + MERN stack. 
> A registered account has already been entered in the input field. Alternativly, you could also register (which would send you a register link).
> As a registered user, you could do the normal CRUD of your blogs if you do decide to publish(random posts are welcome 😊)
> If the post is well organized (h1 h2 and some lists), your posts should be indexed by google in a few days (hopefully if my code works as expected 🤞)
> Good luck and hope you enjoy

> Last but not least, it's Facebook link share friendly as well (Description and image and would display)
